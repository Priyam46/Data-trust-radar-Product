# Problem Discovery

The idea for Data Trust Radar emerged from repeated production data incidents
where business users escalated issues after dashboards had already been used in decision-making.

## Observations

- Dashboards failed silently
- Business users had no way to assess data reliability
- Engineers learned about issues only after escalations
- Trust in analytics eroded over time

---

## Stakeholder Interviews

Interviews were conducted with:
- BI Analysts
- Finance users
- Sales Operations managers
- Data Engineers

---

## Key Insight

Business users do not care about technical data quality metrics.
They care about whether a number is safe to use in meetings and reports.

Data trust is emotional and contextual, not technical.
