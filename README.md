# Data Trust Radar

Data Trust Radar is an internal product designed to help business users confidently answer one simple question:

**Can I trust this data right now?**

Instead of exposing raw data quality metrics meant for engineers, the product translates pipeline health signals into clear, human-readable trust indicators embedded directly inside BI dashboards.

---

## Problem

In most organizations, data quality issues are discovered only after business users escalate discrepancies.
Dashboards break silently due to delayed data loads, schema changes, or volume anomalies.

Existing data observability tools focus on engineering teams, leaving decision-makers blind to data reliability.

---

## Solution

Data Trust Radar treats **data trust as a product**, not an operational afterthought.

It assigns a daily trust score to datasets based on:
- Freshness
- Volume stability
- Schema stability
- Downstream business impact

These scores are surfaced directly inside BI dashboards as intuitive trust badges.

## Outcomes

- Reduced data-related escalations
- Increased analytics adoption
- Faster detection of silent data failures
- Improved confidence in business reporting

## Product Status

Pilot-level internal product designed for enterprise analytics teams.
